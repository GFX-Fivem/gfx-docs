# GFX Scripts Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **GFX Scripts** — a collection of premium FiveM resources for PVP, roleplay, and hybrid servers.

## What is GFX?

GFX Scripts is a suite of 70+ FiveM resources built for performance and compatibility. All scripts share a unified library (`gfx-lib`) that handles framework detection, inventory bridging, and common utilities — so you can mix and match scripts without configuration headaches.

## Key Features

- **Multi-framework** — QBCore and ESX supported out of the box
- **Multi-inventory** — ox_inventory, qb-inventory, gfx-inventory, qs-inventory, and more
- **Escrow + Open Source** — Every script available in both variants on Tebex
- **Shared library** — `gfx-lib` provides callbacks, notifications, vehicle keys, fuel, and more
- **Cross-script integration** — Crews, squads, safezones, arenas, and other systems talk to each other via exports
